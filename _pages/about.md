## üåê Welcome to my personal web page! 


I am currently a Ph.D. student at the AI4LS Laboratory and [Multimedia Laboratory (MMLab)](https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/) in The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), co-supervised by [Prof. Pheng Ann Heng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=OFdytjoAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and [Prof. Wanli Ouyang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=pw_0Z_UAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). Before joining CUHK, I received my Academic Master's degree in Biomedical Engineering from Tsinghua University. I served as a research intern at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/) and [Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/), and have served as a reviewer for Nature Communications, AISTATS, ICML, ICLR, NeurIPS, and AAAI. 

My research interests are in **AI for science** ‚Äî in particular, machine learning force field, deep generative models, and LLM applications. Feel free to contact me if you are interested in my research.

### Online test-time adaptation for better generalization of interatomic potentials to out-of-distribution data
**Taoyong Cui**, Chenyu Tang, Dongzhan Zhou, Yuqiang Li, Xingao Gong, Wanli Ouyang, Mao Su, Shufei Zhang
- **Description**:  In this work, we propose an online Test-time Adaptation Interatomic Potential (TAIP) framework to improve the generalization on test data. Specifically, we design a dual-level self-supervised learning approach that leverages global structure and atomic local environment information to align the model with the test data.

### MSGNN: Masked Schema based Graph Neural Networks
Hao Liu, Qianwen Yang, **Taoyong Cui**, Wei Wang
- **Description**:In this work, we introduce Masked Schema based Graph Neural Networks (MSGNN), which combines schema instances with bi-level self-supervised learning and mask technique to acquire effective context representations. Furthermore, we propose a decomposition-reconstruction schema instance retrieval strategy to ensure efficient instance searching.

### Geometry-enhanced pretraining on interatomic potentials
**Taoyong Cui**, Chenyu Tang, Mao Su, Shufei Zhang, Yuqiang Li, Lei Bai, Yuhan Dong, Xingao Gong, Wanli Ouyang 
- **Description**: In this work, we propose a geometric structure learning framework that leverages unlabelled configurations to improve the performance of MLIPs. Our framework consists of two stages: first, using classical molecular dynamics simulations to generate unlabelled configurations of the target molecular system; and second, applying geometry-enhanced self-supervised learning techniques, including masking, denoising and contrastive learning, to capture structural information.
