## 🌐 Welcome to my personal web page! 


I am currently a Ph.D. student at the AI4LS Laboratory and [Multimedia Laboratory (MMLab)](https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/) in The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), co-supervised by [Prof. Pheng Ann Heng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=OFdytjoAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and [Prof. Wanli Ouyang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=pw_0Z_UAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). I am honored to serve as a visiting PhD researcher at Yale University, collaborating with [Prof. Rex Ying](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=6fqNXooAAAAJ).

Before joining CUHK, I received my Academic Master's degree in Biomedical Engineering from Tsinghua University. I served as a research intern at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/) and [Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/), and have served as a reviewer for Nature Communications, AISTATS, ICML, ICLR, NeurIPS, and AAAI. 

My research focuses on **AI for Science**, particularly on machine learning force fields, deep generative models, and large language model applications.  You can find more details in my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_8vmQn0AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).  Please feel free to contact me for communication and collaboration.

## 🔍 Selected Research

### Evidential Deep Learning for Interatomic Potentials
Han Xu†, **Taoyong Cui†**, Chenyu Tang1†, Jinzhe Ma, Dongzhan Zhou, Yuqiang Li, Xiang Gao, Xingao Gong, Wanli Ouyang, Shufei Zhang, Mao Su (†These authors contributed equally to this work.)
- **Description**:In this work, we show an evidential deep learning framework for interatomic potentials with a physics-inspired design. Our method provides uncertainty quantification without significant computational overhead or decreased prediction accuracy, consistently outperforming other methods across a variety of datasets.
- <span style="color: red;">Note: This paper has been accepted at [Nature Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13994).</span>

### Online test-time adaptation for better generalization of interatomic potentials to out-of-distribution data
**Taoyong Cui**, Chenyu Tang, Dongzhan Zhou, Yuqiang Li, Xingao Gong, Wanli Ouyang, Mao Su, Shufei Zhang
- **Description**:  In this work, we propose an online Test-time Adaptation Interatomic Potential (TAIP) framework to improve the generalization on test data. Specifically, we design a dual-level self-supervised learning approach that leverages global structure and atomic local environment information to align the model with the test data.

### Geometry-enhanced pretraining on interatomic potentials
**Taoyong Cui**, Chenyu Tang, Mao Su, Shufei Zhang, Yuqiang Li, Lei Bai, Yuhan Dong, Xingao Gong, Wanli Ouyang 
- **Description**: In this work, we propose a geometric structure learning framework that leverages unlabelled configurations to improve the performance of MLIPs. Our framework consists of two stages: first, using classical molecular dynamics simulations to generate unlabelled configurations of the target molecular system; and second, applying geometry-enhanced self-supervised learning techniques, including masking, denoising and contrastive learning, to capture structural information.
