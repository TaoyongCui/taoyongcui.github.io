## About Me
I am a Ph.D. candidate at **The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)**, starting in 2024. My research focuses on Artificial intelligence (AI) for drug design. I am particularly interested in AI for Post-translational modification (PTM). Previously, I completed my undergraduate studies at Shandong University (SDU), where I developed a strong foundation in computer science and bioinformatics.
