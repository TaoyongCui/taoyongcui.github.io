## About Me

Welcome to my personal web page! 

I am currently a Ph.D. student at the AI4LS Laboratory and [Multimedia Laboratory (MMLab)](https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/) in The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), co-supervised by [Prof. Pheng Ann Heng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=OFdytjoAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and [Prof. Wanli Ouyang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=pw_0Z_UAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). Before joining CUHK, I received my Academic Master's degree in Biomedical Engineering from Tsinghua University. I served as a research intern at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/) and [Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/), and have served as a reviewer for AISTATS, ICML, ICLR, NeurIPS, and AAAI. My research interests are in AI for science ‚Äî in particular, machine learning force field, deep generative models, and LLM applications. 

Feel free to contact me if you are interested in my research.
